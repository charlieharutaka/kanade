## Getting Started

First, run the development server (with pnpm cuz its cool):

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:2500](http://localhost:2500) with your browser to see the result (2500 because 25-ji get it :))).

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. altho i don't plan on using the api lawl
